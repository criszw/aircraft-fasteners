# aircraft-fasteners
Montgomery and Peck (1982) describe a study on the compressive strength of the alloy fastener used in the construction of aircraft. ten pressure loads from 2500 psi to 4300 psi were used with different number of fasteners being tested at each of these levels. The number of fasteners failing at each load were recorded.

Create a model that predicts the probability that a fastener passes based on load.
